<h2>Repo</h2>

<p>This tab gives you access to the full catalog of apps available for CachyOS Linux. It has a limited feature set and is not a replacement for a full package manager like the default Synaptic.  Consider the CachyOS PackageInstaller supplementary to Synaptic. </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Packages then can be manipulated in similar fashion to the Popular Applications Tab.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Flatpaks</h2>

<p><a href="https://flatpak.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Flatpaks (opens in a new tab)">Flatpaks</a> are a type of package that has all the dependencies included that&#8217;s supposed to work on multiple Linux distributions.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>They are not perfect: some might not work well, might not follow your theme, etc.</li>
		<li> The first flatpak that you install will probably pull a huge runtime, so it will take a long time to download and will take a lot of space on your harddrive (probably around 2GB), but the next flatpak will most likely be able to use that runtime, so it gets a bit better after you install a couple of flatpaks.</li>
		<li> By default, the &#8220;flathub&#8221; remote &#8220;repo&#8221; is used by default.  Others can be added via the Advanced dialog.</li>
		<li> You can also install flatpaks via ref files via the Advanced dialog</li>
	</ul>
